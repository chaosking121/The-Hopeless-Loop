The very thought of it seemed absurd. After all those years, after everything I had seen along the way, there comes a point where you start to think you’ve seen it all. And, for the most part, when I started to 
think that way, I was right.

{: style="text-align:right"}
It had been countless eons since I had witnessed something I could even for a second call a miracle. Even 
the word seemed to have been lost to me, as the ones that I did witness, always turned out to be false. Every single time.

{: style="text-align:right"}
But, as I knelt over his body, trying to salvage his very existence, I was at a loss, searching for a way 
to explain what had just happened. And I kept failing, again and again, to rationalize it. There was no doubting it. I very clearly felt the sigil within his mind take shape as he distilled his existence down to a single wish.

{: style="text-align:right"}
To save me.

{: style="text-align:right"}
Suddenly, a breath.

{: style="text-align:right"}
He wasn’t lost after all. Another miracle.

{: style="text-align:right"}
I was so sure that it was a talent that I alone possessed. I, who was more powerful than any other, was 
the only one in creation who could form a sigil within myself.

{: style="text-align:right"}
At least, until he came along.

{: style="text-align:right"}
What was he?

{: style="text-align:right"}
Where did he come from?

{: style="text-align:right"}
Why does he exist?

{: style="text-align:right"}
What was his purpose in my life?

{: style="text-align:right"}
What was my purpose in his?

{: style="text-align:right"}
As I tried sigil after sigil to cement his existence to this world once more, these questions raced 
through my mind. They had lingered there, in some shape or form, since I had first met him, but it was only then that I understood how important he was, and it far exceeded what I had expected.

{: style="text-align:right"}
At that time, as I desperately tried to save him, I didn’t care about the miracle that he had performed, 
or the impossibility of his presence in that world. I cared only for the person that cared more about me, the monster who ended creation, than any other had throughout my endless existence.

{: style="text-align:right"}
Here he was, at the end of my life, the one person who did not fear me, who had no plans of using me or my 
power, who was willing to save me even at the cost of his own life.

{: style="text-align:right"}
A heartbeat.

{: style="text-align:right"}
A debt repaid.

{: style="text-align:right"}
And yet, I shed a tear, perhaps the first in hundreds of years, over just how close he had come to joining 
me in my eventual demise. And as I did, I lamented the cruel hand of fate, which doomed us to part once and for all, in the coming days.

{: style="text-align:right"}
But, I thought to myself with renewed resolve as I landed him softly on the floor of that house, I would 
see this through to the end, I owed him that much, there was no doubt.

{: style="text-align:right"}
My last thought as I too drifted away into sleep, another first, was just how much his innocence gave me 
hope, that I may be forgiven of my forever sin.

{: style="text-align:right"}
I would have to tell him, I decided, as my head hit the floorboard, but there would be time for that 
later, when the sun rose again.

{: style="text-align:right"}
And, I slept.
