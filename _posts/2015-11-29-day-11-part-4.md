I stumbled back to the lake. I was quite difficult, considering that my body was just about to give up on me. I couldnâ€™t help but laugh at the thought of how similar it felt to that day, as I dragged my injured body to the lake, where my death awaited me. And so, it was only fitting that I repeat that journey, this time having truly lived, perhaps more than anyone else. Almost anyone.

I was content this time around though, and it would take a lot to wipe the grin off my face as I pushed through the leaves and branches and found myself once more on the shores of that lake. It was as good a place to die as I had ever found in my many years.

And so, it was fitting then, as I sat on the shores of the lake and felt myself slowly drift into the water, that this was the place where I faded to black.
