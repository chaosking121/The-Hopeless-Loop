At first, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I must have went through the five stages of grief in a fraction of a second as I looked on, paralyzed with fear, at the beast, which had Mal in a killing grasp. My mind raced with thoughts. At first, I remembered the watch, which seemed to the logical parts of my mind to be the only way I could get out of this situation alive. That was, if I even had enough Vortex energy left to power it. Mal had said that its requirements were low, but she certainly didn’t account for the feat that I had performed in her calculations.

I remembered her claim that she had a few tricks left to pull once I was safely away, but as I looked on at her limp body hanging, I doubted that there was any trick she could have left that would save her.

And, as I continued to look at that horrifying sight, I began to feel with an intensity that I did not even think was possible. Every emotion under the sun simmered within me, threatening to break free at any moment.

I felt fear, at her impending demise.

{: style="text-align:center"}
I felt sadness, at the thought of losing her.

{: style="text-align:center"}
I felt horror, at her final moments.

{: style="text-align:center"}
I felt pain, at the thought of living without her.

{: style="text-align:center"}
I felt anger, at the one who defeated her.

{: style="text-align:center"}
I felt shame, at my inability to save her.

{: style="text-align:center"}
I felt rage, as I sought to save her.

{: style="text-align:center"}
I felt joy, as I remembered her smile.

{: style="text-align:center"}
I felt content, as I remembered her embrace.

{: style="text-align:center"}
I felt comfort, as I remembered her scent.

{: style="text-align:center"}
I felt infinite, as I remembered the abyss within her eyes.

{: style="text-align:center"}
I felt powerful, as I grasped her dagger.

And so, the vessel that was my soul burst at the seams, spilling out everything within me and threatening to drown the very idea of accepting her defeat. It wasn’t me that willed myself to grip that dagger so tightly that my knuckles threatened to give up, and it certainly wasn’t me that forced my aching muscles to push me forwards. Perhaps it was the idea of me, or maybe the idea of her. 

But, I kept on going. And with every step, I felt myself getting closer and closer to her. Though, I knew somewhere deep within me that it was never going to be enough. So, I searched the depths of the concept of the existence that was me, for the answer to my one true desire, to save her, who had saved me again and again. 

And as I both hoped and feared, the answer lay within me. A sigil, forged in my mind with only the goal of saving her in mind, began to take shape. I forced every last ounce of power through my body and mind, ridding myself of any thought other than that sigil, my path to victory. 

And so, I once again felt the world torn from beneath me. As I did, I raised my hand up high, dagger in hand, and as I reconnected with the earth once again, my hand fell, bearing the strength of all that was me. That blade, that she held so tightly, cut through the hand that held her to her death and set her free. 

Taken aback by my sudden strike, the beast stammered, seemingly unable to believe that I had managed to hurt it. Mal, who wasted not even the smallest fraction of a second even at the brink of death, caught the dagger as it fell from my hands and lunged at the beast, tearing its head and remaining arm from its body with a single strike. 

With the beast dismembered, she plunged her hand in its chest and grasped its Core, that which cemented its existence in a world that wanted so desperately nothing more than to reject its very existence. And so, freed from its anchor to this world, the beast faded, taking with it the object and image of my rage. 

And so, I too faded, content with the miracle I had formed within my own heart.
