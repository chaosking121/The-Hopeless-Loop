A passed out, presumably from the strain of having all his memories returned all at once. I looked forward into the Hall of Memory, to be greeted only by an image of me. An imitation, left to guide me along the path of The Hopeless Loop. An imitation, that I would no doubt be forced to create myself in the near future.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Would you like to initiate the teleport process?” she asked me in that robotic tone.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Yes,” I replied, unsure of what awaited me. What conditions had he been under when I first met him? His future self mentioned saving him, could he be in danger? But, as I felt the preprogrammed sigil activate and take effect, I knew it wouldn’t be long until I found out.

{: style="text-align:right"}
The white flash faded, and I found myself standing atop the roof of a large building. We were hidden from most of the rooftop by some large water tanks, presumably so that I could hide the unconscious A from his past self. So, I did just that before walking around to see the rest of the rooftop. As I had expected, A was waiting for me there. But, I did not expect to see him standing on the edge, looking down at the world below him.

{: style="text-align:right"}
Fearing the worst, I approached him cautiously. Once I was close enough, I decided to try to get his attention without startling him.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Are you going to jump?” I asked, as he peered over the edge.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I’m deathly scared of heights,” he replied, “so sometimes, I think just looking will do the trick.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
There it was, that premonition I had felt at the park. I couldn’t allow him to die like this, I had to stop him, but it would be difficult without even knowing why, so I had to ask, as cliche as it was.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Why are you here?”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“They all ask that, but it’s never a real question, just a guise to get me talking. You don’t care why I’m here.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“You don’t know that. Maybe I’ve been there once myself. And maybe all it would have taken to save my wretched soul was one voice kind enough to ask me how I found myself there in the first place.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“You talk as if you’ve already done it.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Maybe I have.” 

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Cut the crap, it’s not funny.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Well then, humour me. Tell me something that is funny.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
He turned to face me, still teetering on the edge. I knew what that moment was. I knew it well. It was my choke point in the loop. Just as A, who now stood on the edge before me at the brink of death, would one day choose to save me despite knowing the future that awaited me, I now had to save him, despite knowing his future. And maybe it was a hopeless loop after all, because I knew in my heart that this would not be his end. I would not let it happen.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Why are you here? Really?”

{: style="text-align:right"}
Instead of answering, he just stared at me before coming down off the ledge. Once he did, he walked right up to me and looked me dead in the eyes.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I feel like I’ve seen those eyes before somewhere.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“You’re probably mistaken, because these eyes are two of a kind and they’re both in my head.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I still can’t shake the feeling though.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Well, maybe telling me why you’re here might help jog your memory.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“You’re persistent.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“So I’ve been told.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Isn’t it obvious? I’m here for the same reason that anyone ever finds themselves at this point. I’m here because no matter how hard I try, I can’t find a future for myself where I’m happy.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
His words stung, as I remembered that I had once felt the same way as I threw myself out that window and literally ran to my death. But, I reminded myself that I could not let the same fate befall him. After all, my life had come full circle, to the point where I got to jump out that window again, this time with a smile on my face.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“You certainly won’t have one if you jump.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“At least then I’ll know. No matter what I try to think of, it just never seems right for me, as if there’s always something missing. But…”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“But?” I said with a glimmer of hope. It seemed as though he was reconsidering.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Your eyes, there’s just something about them.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Thank you, maybe they’ll be enough to keep you here.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
He chuckled, “Not likely. They’re almost there, but not quite. Even your eyes can’t give me a future where I’m smiling right until the very end.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Well, I might be able to do something about that.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I’ve thought of everything.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I don’t have a lot of time to explain, but I can offer you something more than you’ve ever dreamed of. To put it bluntly, I’m a time traveller, and I can offer you a chance at a life that you haven’t considered. I’ll warn you, there will be times when it is hard, dangerous and quite frankly, very depressing. But, let’s just say that I have it on good faith that you’ll smile even at your end.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I really shouldn’t believe you.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“But?…”

{: style="text-align:right"}
He nodded suddenly to no-one in particular.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“But, I think I’m going to be taking you up on that offer anyway.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“That’s all I needed to hear.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
And so, I searched deep within myself for one final sigil. I didn’t have much strength left in me, so I would need to use just one. Just one sigil to wipe his memories, send him to meet me in the false town and put a password lock on restoring his memories. It was a lot of work, but I had a lot of practice. And so, one of my final sigils took shape in my mind, a single letter A. I reached out and traced it on his forehead, a reminder to my past self just as much a tool to send him to her. And, as my fingers finished tracing, he disappeared from in front of me, setting out on the path that he always had and always will.

{: style="text-align:right"}
But, there was still one last matter to attend to. I turned to face him, who had now woken up and had watched the moment that forever changed his life play out right before him. I walked towards him and held him once more in a deep embrace. I knew it would be my last.
