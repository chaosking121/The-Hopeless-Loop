There was no mistaking it. I clearly felt the use of a sigil. I immediately spun around to be greeted by no-one. Had A teleported himself? It made no sense. Still, even if he had, he couldn’t have gotten very far. I concentrated, trying to lock onto the slight hum that would have resulted from use of Vortex 
energy. I quickly locked onto to his signal, much deeper into the ship. However, I was distinctly aware that something was amiss, as the signal was blurry, as if it was quickly bouncing between two spots. I had to act quick though, so I chalked it up to a quirk of being almost-dead and started making my way as fast as I could to the source of the signal. 

{: style="text-align:right"}
Teleporting would have been quicker, but considering the possibility that another time traveler had been the one responsible for A’s disappearance, I couldn’t risk revealing my position. But, without having to 
adjust myself to his pace, I was able to make my way through the ship much more quickly. I soon found myself at a door, behind which the signal seemed to originate. I hesitated for a moment before walking right through, prepared for the worst on the other side. 

{: style="text-align:right"}
But no matter how much I braced myself mentally, I could not prepare myself for what I found. There, 
sitting at the other end of the room before me, was A. Except, this wasn’t A. He had A’s face, and there was no mistaking that his signal was definitely A’s.

{: style="text-align:right"}
He spoke before I could reason out the rest of the situation.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Mal, nice to see you again.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Who are you? Where is A?!”

{: style="text-align:right"}“I’m A. Or rather, I’m what awaits at the end of the path that he walks. That he always chooses to walk. 
You may know me by another name though, The Shadow King.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“That’s not possible!” I shouted.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Do you know why I got that name? I picked it, not because I told myself that it was my name way back when, but because I’ve spent most of my life in the shadows, trying to protect you.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Well, considering where we are now, you haven’t done a very good job. And to think I told you I was impressed.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Oh come on, it’s not like you’ve made it easy for me.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Why are you here?”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I’m surprised you haven’t figured it out yet.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I don’t have time for this, just tell me.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“The password hint you left said that you must revisit your death and birth. One day, not two. And if you die today then…”

{: style="text-align:right"}
The gears in my head began to spin out of control as I pieced together the implications of what he had just said.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“You can’t be…”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I am. Today is the day you were born, Princess Mal and heir to the empire of the world. The same one, might I add, that you’re about to destroy.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
The blood in my veins would have boiled, had I not been dead.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“But, that can’t be possible. If I was born here as the Emperor’s daughter, and I also destroyed the world, then wouldn’t I have killed myself as an infant?”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“That’s where I come in. The end of my story is always saving you. I wouldn’t have it any other way, to be honest. I know I did a pretty crappy job, with the lame classmates and the whole beast consuming everyone you love, but there’s a limit to the power we can hold.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“And that limit should be far below being able to create a town and separate it from the world to that degree. If you tried to do something like that, even if you were as powerful as I was-”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Let me stop you right there. I’m even stronger than you were. Not by much, but it’s noticeable. And yes, I know that what I’m about to do will cost me my life, but it’s what I’ve always done.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“What you’re suggesting would be a paradox beyond comprehension.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“It is. It’s so vast that it stops being a paradox. It’s a loop. A loop that we’re stuck in and doomed to repeat again and again, powerless to change the outcome.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“A hopeless loop.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“The Hopeless Loop.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“But, then that would mean…”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Yes, you were the one who brought me to the same town I’m about to create. It hasn’t happened for you yet, but it will.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Is that all we are? Do we just save each other at the ends of both our lives? Together, at our prime, 
you and I were deities in our own right. We must have been able to do something.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I’ve tried, but the loop runs deep. It’s a scar that traverses the whole world.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“But The Order fought to correct paradoxes, how could they have not noticed?”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“The Order used The Truth to fight paradoxes. The Truth was never more than a fancy name for your own diary, which you should leave with me, just so you know now. I let them copy some of the sigils to start them off, but I’ve always kept the original with me, waiting for the day where I could return them to you. Your dagger as well. But it seems irresponsible to give a dagger to a baby so I’ll hide it well inside the book.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“But then who created the diary and the dagger?”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I don’t think that we can ever find out…except…”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Except?”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Listen close, time is running out. We can’t fight the Loop. We can’t prevent the fates that either of us 
share. We were too powerful. We were too involved with the fate of the world, and of each other. But, what we can do is make tiny changes each time. And, we can hope that iteration after iteration, those small changes make enough of a difference to break us free of this endless cycle.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I..understand.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“You’ve been around as long as I have, you know I’m right.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“But what of A? Well, the A I know.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“The password is The Hopeless Loop. My last memory before showing up in your town is what you need to be 
looking for. To complete the Loop, I need to save you as a baby, which I really should be doing, and you need to save me then. You’ll understand when you see it.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“So, this is goodbye?”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“There’s never really a thing like a goodbye for us, if you think about it.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I’m sorry for dragging you into this.”

{: style="text-align:right"}“And I’m sorry for dooming you to such a depressing childhood in that town, but neither of us have the 
power to change it, at least, not yet. But, I really must go now. I’ll send younger me here when I’m finished having this chat with him. He, well, I was sort of slow though, so give him a few minutes.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
I nodded.

{: style="text-align:right"}
He suddenly turned towards me with an unexpected smile on his face.

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Oh and Mal?”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“Yes?”

{: style="text-align:right"}
“I’m glad it was you.”

{: style="text-align:right"}
And with that, he disappeared, off to save my infant self from the destruction that she herself would one 
day bring about. I collapsed, trying to begin to process even just the scale of what had just happened. I was no stranger to time travel at the highest level, but even this was a lot to take in. It was quite ironic that in the final moments of my life, I had learned the truth behind the mysteries that had haunted me since my earliest thoughts. I had always imagined this moment, but in my mind it was always more gratifying.

{: style="text-align:right"}
I felt as though answers would bring me peace, but as I sat there on that floor, I felt nothing of the sort. The answers surrounding my origin and end were just as tragic as the rest of my life had been, but 
what’s worse was coming to terms that I doomed another to share in the cruel hands of that hopeless loop. It truly was a loop like no other, as by saving the other, we both damned them and thus ourselves to the lives that we knew awaited us. Yet, I felt it strange in that moment that there was no regret left in me. Perhaps there was peace for me then, in knowing that despite the atrocities I had committed, there would always be one willing to doom himself for me, and as I awaited his return, I cemented my resolve that I would do the same for him when the time came.

{: style="text-align:right"}
And so, I waited until he appeared suddenly, walking through the wall and staring at me with those wide, naive eyes.

{: style="text-align:right"}
I was wrong.

{: style="text-align:right"}
There was certainly peace to be felt, in knowing that no matter what his life may hold because of my 
interference, that even at its end, he would still have a smile on his face.
