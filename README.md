“What secrets lurk in the abyss that is her soul?”

When A awakes on the sidewalk of an unfamiliar town with no memory of who he is or how he got there, it’s not surprising that he’s clueless about how how he should proceed. Perhaps them, it’s a good that he quickly comes across the mysterious Mal, who is troubled by a mystery of her own.

Together, the pair delve deep into the mystery of the town and their own lives. Along the way, they begin to piece together a puzzle that’s bigger than they could have ever imagined. With no idea how deep it goes, perhaps the most troubling question they have to answer is, “What fate awaits those, cursed by the hopeless loop?”
